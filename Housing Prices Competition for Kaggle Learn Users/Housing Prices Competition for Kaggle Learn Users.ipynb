    "### Goal\n",
    "It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Metric\n",
    "Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission File Format\n",
    "The file should contain a header and have the following format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Id,SalePrice\n",
    "1461,169000.1\n",
    "1462,187724.1233\n",

    "etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can download an example submission file (sample_submission.csv) on the Data page."
